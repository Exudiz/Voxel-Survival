# Voxel Survival

Voxel Survival is an open-source voxel-based survival game where players gather resources, craft tools, survive the world, and shape the environment.  
The project is now community-driven — anyone can contribute, improve the engine, add features, or help expand the world.

This game is built with the vision of becoming a fully moddable, open voxel survival experience inspired by classic sandbox games, but with unique mechanics like weather effects, debris washing ashore, temperature-based happiness, AI tribes, and resource ecosystems.
